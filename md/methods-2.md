## forEach() ##
```const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];```

Challenges:
1. Print each number in the console. 🟢
2. Multiply each number by 2 and print the result. 🟢
3. Find the sum of all numbers. 🔴
4. Find the product of all numbers. 🔴


## map() ##
```const words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];```

2. Create a new array where each word is reversed. 🔴
3. Create a new array where each word is replaced by its length. 🟢
4. Create a new array where each word is replaced by its first letter. 🟢



## Sets ##

```js const setA = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const setB = new Set([3, 4, 5]);
```

**Challenges:**
1. Combine both sets without duplicates 🟠
2. Check if all elements of setA are present in setB 🔴
3. Create a set of unique characters from a string 🟢




## forEach with Sets ##
```js 
const myMap = new Map([
  ['a', 1],
  ['b', 2],
  ['c', 3]
]);
```

**Challenges:**
1. Use forEach on the Map to log key-value pairs
2. Modify each value in the Map using forEach
3. Perform operations on elements in the Set using forEach
4. Combine the Map and Set using their values


## Final Challenge ##

Scenario: You are given a list of products sold in a store. Each product has a name, category, and price. The data is represented as an array of objects.

```JS
const products = [
  { name: 'Apple', category: 'Fruit', price: 1.5 },
  { name: 'Banana', category: 'Fruit', price: 0.5 },
  { name: 'Carrot', category: 'Vegetable', price: 0.7 },
  { name: 'Potato', category: 'Vegetable', price: 0.3 },
  { name: 'Milk', category: 'Dairy', price: 2.0 },
  { name: 'Cheese', category: 'Dairy', price: 3.0 }
];
```
1. Print the name and price of each product.
2. Create a new list where the price of each product is increased by 10%.
3. Identify the unique categories of products.
4. For each category, find the average price of products.
5. Find the most expensive product in each category.
